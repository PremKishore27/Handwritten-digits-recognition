# Handwritten-digits-recognition
we have performed handwritten digit recognition with the help of MNIST datasets using Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) models. Our main objective is to compare the accuracy of the models stated above along with their execution time to get the best possible model for digit recognition.
